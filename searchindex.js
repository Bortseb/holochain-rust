Calling table_actor_ref.commit(entry) looks like this: the actor ref constructs a Protocol::PutPair message including the entry the actor ref calls its own ask method, which builds a future using riker's ask the actor ref blocks on its internal future the referenced actor receives the Commit message and matches/destructures this into the entry the entry is passed to the commit() method of the inner table the actor's inner table, implementing HashTable , does something with commit (e.g. MemTable inserts into a standard Rust, in-memory HashMap ) the return value of the inner table commit is inserted into a CommitResult message the CommitResult message is sent by the actor back to the actor ref's internal future the actor ref stops blocking the CommitResult message is destructured by the actor ref so that the return of commit satisfies the HashTable trait implementation Riker ask returns a future from the futures 0.2.2 crate. table_actor.block_on_ask() calls block_on and unwrap against this ask.

In order to get to libraries that can be linked against when building HoloSqape for Android, you basically just need to setup up according targets for cargo. Given that the Android SDK is installed, here are the steps to setting things up for building: Install the Android tools: a. Install Android Studio b. Open Android Studio and navigate to SDK Tools: - MacOS: Android Studio > Preferences > Appearance & Behaviour > Android SDK > SDK Tools - Linux: Configure (gear) > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK c. Check the following options for installation and click OK: * Android SDK Tools * NDK * CMake * LLDB d. Get a beverage of your choice (or a full meal for that matter) why you wait for the lengthy download Setup ANDROID_HOME env variable: On MacOS export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk Linux: (assuming you used defaults when installing Android Studio) export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk Create standalone NDKs (the commands below put the NDK in your home dir but you can put them where you like): export NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk-bundle\ncd ~\nmkdir NDK\n${NDK_HOME}/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --api 26 --arch arm64 --install-dir NDK/arm64\n${NDK_HOME}/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --api 26 --arch arm --install-dir NDK/arm\n${NDK_HOME}/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --api 26 --arch x86 --install-dir NDK/x86 Add the following lines to your ~/.cargo/config : [target.aarch64-linux-android]\nar = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/arm64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-ar\"\nlinker = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/arm64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-clang\" [target.armv7-linux-androideabi]\nar = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/arm/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-ar\"\nlinker = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/arm/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-clang\" [target.i686-linux-android]\nar = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/x86/bin/i686-linux-android-ar\"\nlinker = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/x86/bin/i686-linux-android-clang\" (this toml file needs absolute paths, so you need to prefix the path with your home dir). Now you can add those targets to your rust installation with: rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android Finally, should now be able to build Holochain for Android with your chosen target, e.g.: cd <holochain repo>\ncargo build --target armv7-linux-androideabi --release NOTE: there is currently a problem in that wabt (which we use in testing as a dev dependency) won't compile on android, and the cargo builder compiles dev dependencies even though they aren't being used in release builds.

Because app data storage is distributed amongst user-participants, one must expect that data encryption and permissions are important for protecting privacy in accordance with the jurisdictions in which the app is operating. Remember that, as user-participants leave the application, they take their data with them. They also retain copies of other data that they held to support the DHT.

Compare this to a Zome Callback Function, which is implemented by the zome code and called by Holochain. So, zome functions (functions in the zome code) are called by Holochain, which can optionally call Zome API Functions, and then finally return a value back to Holochain. Holochain blocks -> calls zome function -> executes WASM logic compiled from zome language -> zome logic calls zome API function -> Holochain natively executes zome API function -> Holochain returns value to zome function -> zome function returns some value -> Holochain receives final value of zome function Each Zome API Function has a canonical name used internally by Holochain. Zome code can be written in any language that compiles to WASM. This means the canonical function name and the function name in the zome language might be different. The zome language will closely mirror the canonical names, but naming conventions such as capitalisation of the zome language are also respected. For example, the canonical verify_signature might become verifySignature in JavaScript. When a zome API function is called from within zome code a corresponding Rust function is called. The Rust function is passed the current zome runtime and the arguments that the zome API function was called with. The Rust function connects zome logic to Holochain core functionality and often has side effects. The return value of the Rust function is passed back to the zome code as the return of the zome API function.","breadcrumbs":"Building Holochain Apps » Overview","id":"zome/api_functions.html#overview","title":"Overview"},"zome/api_functions.html#property":{"body":"Canonical name: property Returns an application property, which are defined by the app developer in the DNA.

Implement a public function as invoke_<canonical name> . The function must take two arguments, a &mut nucleus::ribosome::Runtime and a &wasmi::RuntimeArgs . This function will be called by the invocation dispatch (see above). Zome API function arguments The wasmi::RuntimeArgs passed to the Zome API function contains only a single u32 value. This is an encoded representation of a single page of memory supported by the memory manager. The 16 high bits are the memory offset and the 16 low bits are the memory length. See the wasm_utils crate for more implementation details. You don't have to work with the memory manager directly, simply pass the runtime and runtime args to nucleus::runtime_args_to_utf8 to get a utf-8 string from memory. You DO have to handle serialization round trips if you want to pass anything other than a single utf-8 string to a zome API function. The simplest way to do this is implement a struct that derives Serialize and Deserialize from serde, then use serde and .into_bytes() co-ordinate the round trip. For an example implementation of a struct with several fields see: nucleus::ribosome::commit::CommitArgs for the input args struct nucleus::ribosome::commit::tests::test_args_bytes serializing the struct as bytes nucleus::ribosome::commit::invoke_commit deserializing the struct from the runtime Zome API function action dispatch If the function has a side effect it must send an action to the state reduction layer. Actions are covered in more detail in the state chapter. In summary, if you want to send an action and wait for a return value: create an outer channel in the scope of your invoke function that will receive the return value call ::instance::dispatch_action_with_observer with: the runtime's channels the action the reducer will dispatch on an observer sensor, which is a closure that polls for the action result and sends to your outer channel block the outer channel until you receive the action result Zome API function return values The zome API function returns a value to wasm representing success or a wasm trap. The success value can only be a single i32 . Traps are a low level wasm concern and are unlikely to be directly useful to a zome API function implementation. See https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/Semantics.md#traps To get complex values out of wasm we use the memory manager, much like the input argument serialization (see above). The util function nucleus::runtime_allocate_encode_str takes a string, allocates memory and returns the value that the zome API function must return. To return an error relevant to holochain, return Ok with an HcApiReturnCode error enum variant. For an example implementation returning a complex struct see: agent::state::ActionResult::GetEntry defining a result containing a Pair struct nucleus::ribosome::get::invoke_get match the action result against the correct enum variant serialize the pair using serde return the result of runtime_allocate_encode_str if the action result variant does NOT match then return HcApiReturnCode::ErrorActionResult","breadcrumbs":"Extending the Holochain Platform » Zome API function ribosome module","id":"zome/implementation.html#zome-api-function-ribosome-module","title":"Zome API function ribosome module"},"zome/implementation.html#zome-api-functions":{"body":"Each zome API function is implemented under nucleus::ribosome::api .
