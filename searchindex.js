build a Holochain app, it is important to first know what a Holochain app is. First, recall that Holochain is an engine which can run your distributed apps. That engine expects and requires your application to be in a certain format which is unique to Holochain. That format is referred to as the \"DNA\" of your application. The DNA of an application exists as a singular file, which is mounted, and executed by Holochain. However, writing your application in a single file, as a developer, would not be feasible or desirable. Instead, you are supplied the tools to store your application code across a set of files within a folder, and tools to build all that code down into one file, in the DNA format. While there are lots of details to learn about Holochain and DNA, it can be useful to first look from a general perspective. [TODO: insert note about use of biological language throughout. imperfect but the closest thing]","breadcrumbs":"Building Apps","id":"building_apps.html#building-apps","title":"Building Apps"},"building_apps.html#holochain-and-dna":{"body":"Recall that a goal of Holochain is to enable cryptographically secured, tamper-proof peer-to-peer applications. DNA files play a fundamental role in enabling this. Imagine that we think of an application, and its users, as a game. When people play any game, it's important that they play by the same rules, otherwise, they are actually playing different games. With Holochain, a DNA file contains the complete set of rules and logic for an application. Thus, when users independently run an app with identical DNA, they are playing the same game: running the same application with cryptographic security. What this allows in technical terms is that these independent users begin sharing data with one another, and validating one anothers data. Thus, users can interact with the data in this distributed peer-to-peer system with full confidence in the integrity of that data. The key takeaway from this is that if you change the DNA (the configuration, validation rules, and application logic), and a user runs it, they are basically running a different app. If this brings up questions for you about updating your application to different versions, good catch. This concern will be addressed later in this section. For now, take a look at DNA in closer detail.","breadcrumbs":"Holochain and DNA","id":"building_apps.html#holochain-and-dna","title":"Holochain and DNA"},"building_for_android.html#building-for-android":{"body":"Note: These instructions for building Holochain on Android are adapted from here . In order to get to libraries that can be linked against when building HoloSqape for Android, you basically just need to setup up according targets for cargo. Given that the Android SDK is installed, here are the steps to setting things up for building: Install the Android tools: a. Install Android Studio b. Open Android Studio and navigate to SDK Tools: - MacOS: Android Studio > Preferences > Appearance & Behaviour > Android SDK > SDK Tools - Linux: Configure (gear) > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK c. Check the following options for installation and click OK: * Android SDK Tools * NDK * CMake * LLDB d. Get a beverage of your choice (or a full meal for that matter) why you wait for the lengthy download Setup ANDROID_HOME env variable: On MacOS export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk Linux: (assuming you used defaults when installing Android Studio) export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk Create standalone NDKs (the commands below put the NDK in your home dir but you can put them where you like): export NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk-bundle\ncd ~\nmkdir NDK\n${NDK_HOME}/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --api 26 --arch arm64 --install-dir NDK/arm64\n${NDK_HOME}/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --api 26 --arch arm --install-dir NDK/arm\n${NDK_HOME}/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --api 26 --arch x86 --install-dir NDK/x86 Add the following lines to your ~/.cargo/config : [target.aarch64-linux-android]\nar = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/arm64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-ar\"\nlinker = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/arm64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-clang\" [target.armv7-linux-androideabi]\nar = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/arm/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-ar\"\nlinker = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/arm/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-clang\" [target.i686-linux-android]\nar = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/x86/bin/i686-linux-android-ar\"\nlinker = \"<your $HOME value here>/NDK/x86/bin/i686-linux-android-clang\" (this toml file needs absolute paths, so you need to prefix the path with your home dir). Now you can add those targets to your rust installation with: rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android Finally, should now be able to build Holochain for Android with your chosen target, e.g.: cd <holochain repo>\ncargo build --target armv7-linux-androideabi --release NOTE: there is currently a problem in that wabt (which we use in testing as a dev dependency) won't compile on android, and the cargo builder compiles dev dependencies even though they aren't being used in release builds.

Calling table_actor_ref.commit(entry) looks like this: the actor ref constructs a Protocol::PutPair message including the entry the actor ref calls its own ask method, which builds a future using riker's ask the actor ref blocks on its internal future the referenced actor receives the Commit message and matches/destructures this into the entry the entry is passed to the commit() method of the inner table the actor's inner table, implementing HashTable , does something with commit (e.g. MemTable inserts into a standard Rust, in-memory HashMap ) the return value of the inner table commit is inserted into a CommitResult message the CommitResult message is sent by the actor back to the actor ref's internal future the actor ref stops blocking the CommitResult message is destructured by the actor ref so that the return of commit satisfies the HashTable trait implementation Riker ask returns a future from the futures 0.2.2 crate. table_actor.block_on_ask() calls block_on and unwrap against this ask.

However, you probably shouldn't try to do it in the way everyone is used to building cryptocurrencies on a global ledger of cryptographic tokens. Determining the status of tokens/coins is what create the need for global consensus (about the existence/status/validity of the token or coin). However, there are other approaches to making currencies which, for example, involve issuance via mutual credit instead of issuance by fiat.

Like cutting a hologram, if you were to cut a Holochain network in half (make it so half the nodes were isolated from the other half), you would have two whole, functioning systems, not two partial, broken systems. This seems to be the strategy used to create resilience in natural systems. For example, where is your DNA stored? Every cell carries its own copy, with different functions expressed based on the role of that cell. Where is the English language stored? Every speaker carries it. People have different areas of expertise, or exposure to different slang or specialized vocabularies. Nobody has a complete copy, nor is anyone's version exactly the same as anyone else, If you disappeared half of the English speakers, it would not degrade the language much. If you keep cutting a hologram smaller and smaller eventually the image degrades enough to stop being recognizable, and depending on the resiliency rules for DHT neighborhoods, holochains would likely share a similar fate.

Instead, each node that receives a record of a transaction validates it against the shared application rules and gossips it to their peers. If the rules are broken, that transaction is rejected by the validator. If foul play is detected on a node's part (the node is either propagating or validating bad data) that node is blocked and a warning is sent to others. Here's an infographic describing this process. In summary, instead of a global consensus system, Holochain uses an accountability-based system with data validation by peers. Applying this to the example of 'Ourbnb', an imaginary distributed version ofAirbnb: The Ourbnb Holochain app would certainly be written with a rule, \"don't rent your apartment to two parties at the same time.\" So the moment a user rents to two parties at the same time, nodes receiving that datum on the DHT attempt to validate it against the app rules, detect a collision, and reject it. Holochain's gossip protocol is designed to operate at a rate at which collisions will be detected nearly immediately by gossiping peers. And since Holochain doesn't have a coin built into it, it incentivizes users to cooperate and co-create. As a user, you don't need to trust the provider of the application you're using, only agree with the shared protocols that make up the application itself. Aside from being responsible for the maintenance and security of apps they provide, application providers on Holochain are not like traditional application providers today (think Facebook, Twitter, etc.). They don't host your data because your data is stored by you and a random subset of the users of the application.","breadcrumbs":"How are data validated on Holochain?","id":"faq.html#how-are-data-validated-on-holochain","title":"How are data validated on Holochain?"},"faq.html#how-is-holochain-different-from-__________":{"body":"TODO: Update with reference to Rust project.

The only validation rules they have is the hash of the data itself to confirm what you're getting is probably what you intended to get. They have no other means to confirm authenticity, provenance, timelines, or integrity of data sources. In fact, since many DHTs are used for illegal file sharing (Napster, Bittorrent, Sharezaa, etc.), they are designed to protect anonymity of uploaders so they won't get in trouble. File sharing DHTs frequently serve virus infected files, planted by uploaders trying to infect digital pirates. There's no accountability for actions or reliable way to ensure bad data doesn't spread. By embedding validation rules as a condition for the propagation of data, our DHT keeps its data bound to signed source chains. This can provide similar consistency and rule enforcement as blockchain ledgers asynchronously so bottlenecks of immediate consensus become of the thing of the past. The DHT leverages the signed source chains to ensure tamper-proof immutability of data, as well as cryptographic signatures to verify its origins and provenance. The Holochain DHT also emulates aspects of a graph database by enabling people to connect links to other hashes in the DHT tagged with semantic markers. This helps solve the problem of finding the hashes that you want to retrieve from the DHT. For example, if I have the hash of your user identity, I could query it for links to blogs you've published to a holochain so that I can find them without knowing either the hash or the content. This is part of how we eliminate the need for tracking nodes that many DHTs rely on.","breadcrumbs":"How is Holochain different from a DHT (Distributed Hash Table)?","id":"faq.html#how-is-holochain-different-from-a-dht-distributed-hash-table","title":"How is Holochain different from a DHT (Distributed Hash Table)?"},"faq.html#how-is-holochain-different-from-blockchain":{"body":"Holochain and blockchain are built for fundamentally different use cases. Blockchain is relatively good for systems where it’s absolutely necessary to maintain global consensus. Holochain is much better than blockchain at anything that requires less than universal consensus (most things): It’s faster, more efficient, more scalable, adaptable, and extendable. Long before blockchains were hash chains and hash trees . These structures can be used to ensure tamper-proof data integrity as progressive versions or additions to data are made. These kinds of hashes are often used as reference points to ensure data hasn't been messed with—like making sure you're getting the program you meant to download, not some virus in its place. Instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has their own signed hash chain ( countersigned for transactions involving others). After data is signed to local chains, it is shared to a DHT where every node runs the same validation rules (like blockchain nodes all run the same validation rules . If someone breaks those rules, the DHT rejects their data—their chain has forked away from the holochain. The initial Bitcoin white paper introduced a blockchain as an architecture for decentralized production of a chain of digital currency transactions. This solved two problems (time/sequence of transactions, and randomizing who writes to the chain) with one main innovation of bundling transactions into blocks which somebody wins the prize of being able to commit to the chain if they solve a busywork problem faster than others. Now Bitcoin and blockchain have pervaded people's consciousness and many perceive it as a solution for all sorts of decentralized applications. However, when the problems are framed slightly differently, there are much more efficient and elegant solutions (like holochains) which don't have the processing bottlenecks of global consensus, storage requirements of everyone having a FULL copy of all the data, or wasting so much electricity on busywork.","breadcrumbs":"How is Holochain different from blockchain?","id":"faq.html#how-is-holochain-different-from-blockchain","title":"How is Holochain different from blockchain?"},"faq.html#how-is-holochain-more-environmentally-ethical-than-blockchain":{"body":"Holochain removes the need for global consensus, and with it the expenditure of massive amounts of electricity to synchronize millions of nodes about data that aren't relevant to them. There are two reasons Holochain is vastly more efficient than blockchain and more ethical in a green sense: It eliminates the need for all nodes to be synchronized with each other in global consensus. Sharding is usually enabled on Holochain. This means that when two nodes make a transaction, each node saves a countersigned record of that transaction. Additionally, the transaction is published to the Distributed Hash Table (sent to and saved by some unpredictably random nodes that can be looked up later for retrieval). Sharding is configurable by app, and in some cases it's a good idea to turn it off. For example, imagine a distributed Slack-like team messaging app. With only 40-50 members, full synchronization would be worth the extra bandwidth requirement for the benefit of offline messages and reduced load times. But for most applications, global synchronization isn't really needed and sharding is kept on. Because of DHTs, and the sharding they enable, Holochain actually doesn't rely on the transfer of large amounts of redundant information, and uses vastly less bandwidth than blockchain. There's no mining on Holochain. Blockchain's proof-of-work system provides a hefty incentive for thousands of people to spend the processing power of their CPUs and GPUs using up huge amounts of electricity on solving a meaningless cryptographic puzzle.

Einstein discovered this about the physical world a hundred years ago—Relativity. So why are modern blockchains that are supposedly \"cutting edge\" still falling back on this antiquated idea that data is an object, and for two agents to have different views of one piece of data is wrong?

Also, the redundancy factor of data on a given DHT is configurable so it can be fine-tuned for any purpose.

Some time in the future, I'm sure some applications will add an anonymization layer (like TOR), but that is not native. Large files: Think of holochains more like a database than a file system. Nobody wants to be forced to load and host your big files on their devices just because they are in the neighborhood of its hash. Use something like IPFS if you want a decentralized file system. Data positivist-oriented apps: If you have built all of your application logic around the idea that data exists as an absolute truth, not as an assertion by an agent at a time, then you would need to rethink your whole approach before putting it in a Holochain app. This is why most existing cryptocurrencies would need significant refactoring to move from blockchain to Holochain, since they are organized around managing the existence of cryptographic tokens.","breadcrumbs":"What is Holochain not good for?","id":"faq.html#what-is-holochain--not--good-for","title":"What is Holochain not good for?"},"faq.html#what-is-holochains-consensus-algorithm":{"body":"Holochains don't manage consensus, at least not about some absolute perspective on data or sequence of events. They manage distributed data integrity. Holochains do rely on consensus about the validation rules (DNA) which define that integrity, but so does every blockchain or blockchain alternative (e.g. Bitcoin Core). If you have different validation rules, you're not on the same chain. These validation rules establish the \"data physics,\" and then applications are built on that foundation. In making Holochain, our goal is to keep it \"as simple as possible, but no simpler\" for providing data integrity for fully distributed applications. As we understand it, information integrity does not require consensus about an absolute order of events. You know how we know? Because the real world works this way—meaning, the physically distributed systems outside of computers. Atoms, molecules, cells, bodies each maintain the integrity of their individual and collective state just fine without consensus on a global ledger. Not only is there no consensus about an absolute order of events, but if you understand the General Theory of Relativity, then you'll understand there is in fact no real sequence of events, only sequences relative to a particular vantage point. That's how holochains are implemented. Each source chain for each person/agent/participant in a Holochain preserves the immutable data integrity and order of events of that agent's actions from their vantage point. As data is published from a source chain to the validating DHT, then other agents sign their validation, per the shared \"physics\" encoded into the DNA of that Holochain. The minor exception to the singular vantage point of each chain, is the case when a multi-party transaction is signed to each party's chain. That is an act of consensus -- but consensus on a very small scale -- just between the parties involved in the transaction. Each party signs the exact same transaction to with links to each of their previous chain entries. Luckily, it's pretty easy to reach consensus between 2 or 3 parties. In fact, that is already why they're doing a transaction together, because they all agree to it. Holochains do sign every change of data and timestamp (without a universal time synchronization solution), This provides ample foundation for most applications which need solid data integrity for shared data in a fully distributed multi-agent system. Surely, there will be people who will build consensus algorithms on top of foundation (maybe like rounds, witnesses, supermajorities of Swirld), However, if your system is designed around data having one absolute true state, not one which is dynamic and varied based on vantage point, we would suggest you rethink your design. So far, for every problem space where people thought they needed an absolute sequence of events or global consensus, we have been able to map an alternate approach without those requirements. Also, we already know this is how the world outside of computers works, so to design your system to require (or construct) an artificial reality is probably setting yourself up for failure, or at the very least for massive amounts of unnecessary computation, communication, and fragility within your system.","breadcrumbs":"What is Holochain's consensus algorithm?","id":"faq.html#what-is-holochains-consensus-algorithm","title":"What is Holochain's consensus algorithm?"},"faq.html#what-is-the-tps-transactions-per-second-on-holochain":{"body":"Holochain doesn't have a set TPS (transactions per second) like other blockchain-based or blockchain-derived projects might because there's central point through which all transactions must pass. Instead, Holochain is a generalized protocol for distributed computing. It's common to ask a blockchain project, \"How much can your technology handle? What's its TPS?\" This is because nearly all of these projects are built around the limiting idea of a global ledger. But you are not asking, how many posts per second Facebook can do. Why? Because there is no technical problem, adding more servers to Facebook's data center (only maybe monetary problems). You are not asking how many emails per second the internet can handle, because there is no single bottleneck for email-sending, like there would be with a centralized approach. Why are we seeing a transaction limit with blockchain networks? Because blockchain in a strange way marries a decentralized p2p network of nodes with the logical notion of one absolute truth, i.e. the blockchain being one big decentralized database of transactions. It tries to maintain this way of thinking about apps that we are used to from centralized servers. It forces every node into the same \"consensus\". That is implemented by having everybody share and validate everything. That does work, and maybe there are few usecases (like a global naming system maybe?) where it might be advantageous.. but applying that for everything is nonsensical. Holochain is not forcing such a model. Instead it allows for building applications that are like email. The application is rather like a protocol, or grammar, or (I prefer this language) like a dance. If you know the dance (If you have a copy of the validation rules of the app) you can tell who else is dancing that dance and who is not. The difference between Holochain and something like email is that (similarly to blockhain) Holochain is applying 1. cryptographic signatures and 2. tamper proof hash-chains (hence Holo chain ) so that you can build a distributed system you can trust in. You know it is impossible (I'd rather say: very very hard) to game somebody. This so far was only possible by having trusted authorities like banks or Facebook. So, Holochain as an app framework does not pose any limit of transactions per second because there is no place where all transactions have to go through. It is like asking, \"how many words can humanity speak per second?\" Well, with every human being born, that number increases.

Here we will provide a basic overview of concepts from cryptography that are central to holochains. Then, we will consider the consequences of Holochain's cryptographic architecture for data permissioning, access, and security. Because app data storage is distributed amongst user-participants, one must expect that data encryption and permissions are important for protecting privacy in accordance with the jurisdictions in which the app is operating. Remember that, as user-participants leave the application, they take their data with them. They also retain copies of other data that they held to support the DHT.

The response values from a reduction must be polled directly from the state tree in a thread using a \"sensor\" closure in an observer. Actions are stateless/immutable data structures that are dispatched by modules to communicate a request to do something potentially state changing. Everything in the system should be either stateless or change state only in response to an incoming action. The global state is called \"short term memory\" because it is highly dynamic, readily inspectable, and volatile. It does not survive indefinitely and is best thought of as a cache of recent history.

Hi there! You've discovered the comprehensive Holochain guidebook. Holochain is an open source software library that provides a way for businesses, communities, and other groups to build and run applications which are hosted and validated by the \"users\" themselves. Doing so provides a superior level of agency and autonomy over heavy reliance on the so-called \"cloud\" and other third parties. These applications are known more widely as peer-to-peer, decentralized applications, or dApps. To distinguish between dApps built on Blockchains and those built on Holochain, we preemptively call the latter \"hApps\". A more detailed comparison between Blockchain dApps and Holochain hApps is available here . Holochain provides a cross-platform framework for the development and execution of these applications. By running these kinds of applications, \"users\" cease to merely \"use\". They become \"user-participants\" who are also responsible for hosting and validating the network's data. Applications can be developed utilizing any of the major operating systems, and run on virtually any device. The many benefits and opportunities associated with peer-to-peer dApps (e.g. offloaded server costs, elimination of single points of failure, and flexible governance structures) are made available, and often amplified through the Holochain hApp architecture, on desktops, laptops, and Android (arm64) devices.

Taking care to expose these values as constants will simplify the developer experience. This is done by calling hc_init_globals with an input value of 0.

Here is a complete list: hc_debug hc_call hc_sign hc_verify_signature hc_commit_entry hc_update_entry hc_update_agent hc_remove_entry hc_get_entry hc_link_entries hc_query hc_send hc_start_bundle hc_close_bundle There is a special additional one called hc_init_globals which we will discuss further. The Development Kit should implement and export one function per each native function from the list. The function should be called the same as its native form, but without the prefix. E.g. hc_update_agent should be called update_agent or updateAgent . That function should internally call the native function and handle the additional complexity around that. In order to call these \"external\" functions, you will need to import them and provide their signature, but in a WASM import compatible way. In Rust, for example, this is simply: extern { fn hc_commit_entry(encoded_allocation_of_input: u32) -> u32;\n} TODO: define or link to meaningful function signatures","breadcrumbs":"(E) Extending the Holochain Framework » Crafting the API","id":"writing_development_kit.html#crafting-the-api","title":"Crafting the API"},"writing_development_kit.html#publish-it-and-get-in-touch":{"body":"If you've made it through the process so far, good work.

When it is running the WASM code for a Zome, Holochain has access to both read and write from the WASM memory. The pattern defines that Holochain Zome API functions expect to both give and receive 32 bit integers which actually represent a WASM memory location. So to provide a Holochain Zome API function a complex argument, one must first write it into memory, and then call the function, giving it the memory location. Holochain will pull the argument from memory, execute its behaviour, store the result in memory, and return the memory location of the result. The Zome code then has to also lookup the result by its location in memory. Technically, an app developer can do all of these things if they have a reason to, but most won't want to handle the extra step involving memory. A Development Kit, then, should handle the extra step of writing to memory, and calling the native API function, and reading the result from memory, and returning that instead.

Compare this to a Zome Callback Function, which is implemented by the zome code and called by Holochain.

Holochain blocks -> calls zome function -> executes WASM logic compiled from zome language -> zome logic calls zome API function -> Holochain natively executes zome API function -> Holochain returns value to zome function -> zome function returns some value -> Holochain receives final value of zome function Each Zome API Function has a canonical name used internally by Holochain. Zome code can be written in any language that compiles to WASM. This means the canonical function name and the function name in the zome language might be different. The zome language will closely mirror the canonical names, but naming conventions such as capitalisation of the zome language are also respected. For example, the canonical verify_signature might become verifySignature in JavaScript. When a zome API function is called from within zome code a corresponding Rust function is called. The Rust function is passed the current zome runtime and the arguments that the zome API function was called with. The Rust function connects zome logic to Holochain core functionality and often has side effects.

Implement a public function as invoke_<canonical name> . The function must take two arguments, a &mut nucleus::ribosome::Runtime and a &wasmi::RuntimeArgs . This function will be called by the invocation dispatch (see above). Zome API function arguments The wasmi::RuntimeArgs passed to the Zome API function contains only a single u32 value. This is an encoded representation of a single page of memory supported by the memory manager. The 16 high bits are the memory offset and the 16 low bits are the memory length. See the wasm_utils crate for more implementation details. You don't have to work with the memory manager directly, simply pass the runtime and runtime args to nucleus::runtime_args_to_utf8 to get a utf-8 string from memory. You DO have to handle serialization round trips if you want to pass anything other than a single utf-8 string to a zome API function. The simplest way to do this is implement a struct that derives Serialize and Deserialize from serde, then use serde and .into_bytes() co-ordinate the round trip. For an example implementation of a struct with several fields see: nucleus::ribosome::commit::CommitArgs for the input args struct nucleus::ribosome::commit::tests::test_args_bytes serializing the struct as bytes nucleus::ribosome::commit::invoke_commit deserializing the struct from the runtime Zome API function action dispatch If the function has a side effect it must send an action to the state reduction layer. Actions are covered in more detail in the state chapter. In summary, if you want to send an action and wait for a return value: create an outer channel in the scope of your invoke function that will receive the return value call ::instance::dispatch_action_with_observer with: the runtime's channels the action the reducer will dispatch on an observer sensor, which is a closure that polls for the action result and sends to your outer channel block the outer channel until you receive the action result Zome API function return values The zome API function returns a value to wasm representing success or a wasm trap.
